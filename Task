Explanation:
============
Explanation:

1.  The first and second loops have conditions that are false initially, so they won't execute at all.
2.  The third loop has no condition, so it will run indefinitely until it's interrupted by a break statement. In this example, it's terminated after 1000 iterations.
3.  The fourth loop will execute until i4 reaches 100, incrementing i4 by 1 in each iteration.
4.  The fifth loop will execute until i5 reaches 100, incrementing i5 by 2 in each iteration.

  ====================

 33: 6
 56: 2

    Explanation:
======================
This program takes an array of numbers and reduces each number to a single digit by summing its digits repeatedly until a single digit is obtained.
