# Levels of Abstraction in Programming Languages:

Programming languages can be categorized based on their level of abstraction, which defines how closely the language aligns with machine code and hardware architecture. These levels of abstraction include:

**Low-Level Languages:**
These languages are closer to machine code and directly correspond to the hardware architecture.

**Examples include Assembly language.**

**Mid-Level Languages:**
Mid-level languages provide a balance between high-level and low-level languages.
They offer some level of abstraction from hardware specifics while still allowing fine-grained control over system resources.

**Examples include C and C++.**

**High-Level Languages:**
These languages provide a high level of abstraction from the hardware details, focusing more on problem-solving and algorithm implementation.
They are closer to human language and are easier to understand and use.

**Examples include Python, Java, JavaScript, and Ruby.**
